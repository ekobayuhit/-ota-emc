(internet of things for appliances
energy monitoring controlling)

### What is ιota?
ιota is a concept developed by LJK Electrical Engineering Faculty of Engineering Unsoed in build a network of household appliances to facilitate user control and monitoring. 

ιota is built using the concept of Internet of Things (IoT). Each equipment in otatota is called an individual otatota. Individual ιota can be air conditioning (AC), water heater, lighting
stop contact and so on. People who use ιota are referred to as users of ιota.

Some individuals of ιota can be collected to form a single ecosystem to meet the needs of urban users. There are two types of intelligence in ιota, the first is the intelligence of individual and second is the intelligence ecosystem.

The intelligence of individual ιota is the intelligence used to fulfill the function of each individual ιota itself. While the intelligence of ecosystems ιota is the intelligence developed for all the equipment incorporated in a single ecosystem as a whole to meet the needs of users. Until now has been developed at least three products ιota, namely ι-emc, ι-cac and ι-ace.


### What is i-emc?
ι-emc is a device used for monitoring and controlling electronic equipment. Control on ι-emc can be done manually or automatically.

ι-emc monitor the condition of electronic equipment (active/on or off) as well as monitoring energy use. By monitoring the use of energy then anomaly energy use can be detected. Energy use can be caused by equipment failure. For example, a dirty AC unit will result in increased energy consumption.

In ι-emc there is an individual intelligence ιota. One of ι-emc's ability is to activate equipment connected to it based on time.
